        old pros alike.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>Â½ cup butter or margarine</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Step</h></li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
        <li><h4>Step</h></li>
             <p>Place chicken in a roasting pan; season generously 
                inside and out with onion powder, salt, and pepper. 
                Place 3 tablespoons of butter in chicken cavity; 
                arrange dollops of remaining butter on the outside of 
                chicken. Cut celery into 3 or 4 pieces; place in the 
                chicken cavity.</p>
        <li><h4>Step</h></li>
             <p>Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no 
                longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 
                about 1 hour and 15 minutes. An instant-read 
                thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the 
                thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F 
                (74 degrees C).</p>
        <li><h4>Step</h></li>
             <p>Remove from the oven and baste with drippings. Cover with 
                aluminum foil and allow to rest for about 30 minutes 
                before serving.</p>
    </ol>
