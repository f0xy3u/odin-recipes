    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Step</h></li>
            <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a
             Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.
             Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato
             paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 
             tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, 
             Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. 
             Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring 
             occasionally.</p>
        <li><h4>Step</h></li>
             <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
             Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 
             minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. 
             In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, 
             remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon 
             salt.</p>
        <li><h4>Step</h></li>
             <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
        <li><h4>Step</h></li>
             <p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in
             the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 
             noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 
             of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the 
             mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce 
             over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan 
             cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining 
             mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to 
             prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking 
             spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p>
        <li><h4>Step</h></li>
             <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove 
             the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest 
             lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
