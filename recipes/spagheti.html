    <h2>Fun facts</h2>
    <p>Recipe passed on from my Italian grandfather. 
        The ultimate comfort food. Leftovers freeze nicely!
         To make this recipe more authentic, you can use a 
         mixture of ground veal, pork, and beef. You can 
         also substitute the balsamic vinegar for 1/2 cup 
         of red wine.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>3 slices bacon, diced</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 carrot, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>2 (28 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Step</h></li>
            <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a
             Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.
             Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato
             paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 
             tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, 
             Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. 
             Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring 
             occasionally.</p>
        <li><h4>Step</h></li>
             <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
             Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 
             minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. 
             In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, 
             remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon 
             salt.</p>
        <li><h4>Step</h></li>
             <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
        <li><h4>Step</h></li>
             <p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in
             the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 
             noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 
             of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the 
             mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce 
             over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan 
             cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining 
             mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to 
             prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking 
             spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p>
        <li><h4>Step</h></li>
             <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove 
             the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest 
             lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
